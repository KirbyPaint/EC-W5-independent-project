Calculations for age on other planets, to FOUR significant figures:

Mercury - Age * 4.1628
Venus - 1.6280
Mars - 0.5310
Jupiter - 0.0845
Saturn - 0.0337
Uranus - 0.0116
Neptune - 0.0059

Honorary mention Pluto (you will always be a planet in my heart, buddy) - 0.0040

Data collected by entering my age here as the base:
https://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/age/

Website listed age as 25.8, I will use just 25 for a cleaner result.
Always round down for consistency.

Given that my age is 25 and I am rounding down from nearest 4 significant figures I should get the following:

Mercury - 104 (original 104.07)
Venus - 40 (original 40.7)
Earth - 25
Mars - 13 (original 13.275)
Jupiter - 2 (original 2.1125)

The below will always round to zero but here are the results anyhow
Saturn - 0 (original 0.8425)
Uranus - 0 (original 0.2900)
Neptune - 0 (original 0.1475)
Pluto - 0 (original 0.1000)

Life Expectancy
Y'all makin me do math I haven't done in forever haha

Given that my age is 25, and let's say I am expected to live to 80, I have lived 31.25% of my life. Wow little bit of a crisis here but ok.

Now, my age on Mercury will be 104, so I've blown right past the Earthen L.E. A Mercurian's comparable life expectancy would be 

25 / 80 = 104 / x
25x = 80 * 104
25x = 8320
x = 332.8

So, on Mercury, I would be expected to live to 332.8, and I should have a WHOPPING 228.8 years left in me. I'm gonna live forever.

So, the function to determine the life expectancy in converted years will be:

(earthAge * supergalacticLifeExpectancy) = (earthLifeExpectancy * supergalacticAge)
supergalacticLifeExpectancy = (life expectancy * supergalacticAge) / earthenAge

And the years expected to live will be (supergalacticLifeExpectancy - supergalacticAge)
wham bam, thank you ma'am

Both the supergalacticLifeExpectancy and the years left to live will be rounded DOWN, as all previous numbers have been. So I will live to be 332 years and have 228 years remaining.

UPDATE AT 10:30 AM - The life expectancy can just be calculated by running the LE through the dang planet age calculator!!! So if the Earthen LE is 80, the Mercurian will be... 333. NOT 332.

Meaning my new years left goes to **229**

Notes for instructors:

The initial commit accidentally passed the first test. I was just trying to get everything set up and have it ready for testing, but the test just expected the given age, and the constructor as initialized just returned the age, so it passed right off the bat...

As I understood it, you wanted to see the test code be written FIRST. Each test (after the very first one) is written as only a test, with no corresponding function, so it returns a bad fail. Then, I create the function to simply return the entered age, unmodified, so that it got a GOOD fail. Then I coded the function, and it returned a success. I tried to keep that as consistent as possible, but I wasn't 100% sure if I was supposed to even code the bare function or not before committing the test that the not-yet-existing function would actually connect to. I hope that is ok, and if not, at least I've explained where I was coming from on this one.
