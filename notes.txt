Calculations for age on other planets, to FOUR significant figures:

Mercury - Age * 4.1628

Mars - 0.5310
Jupiter - 0.0845
Saturn - 0.0337
Uranus - 0.0116

Data collected by entering my age here as the base:
https://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/age/

Website listed age as 25.8, I will use just 25 for a cleaner result.
Always round down for consistency.

Given that my age is 25 and I am rounding down from nearest 4 significant figures I should get the following:

Mercury - 104 (original 104.07)
Venus - 40 (original 40.7)
Earth - 25
Mars - 13 (original 13.275)
Jupiter - 2 (original 2.1125)

The below will always round to zero but here are the results anyhow
Saturn - 0 (original 0.8425)
Uranus - 0 (original 0.2900)
Neptune - 0 (original 0.1475)
Pluto - 0 (original 0.1000)
