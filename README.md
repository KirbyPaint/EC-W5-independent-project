# _Galactic Age Calculator_

#### _Website to demonstrate test-driven development, understanding of webpack, and ES6 functionality_

#### By _**Ash Porter (KirbyPaint)**_

## Description

The purpose of this website is to demonstrate a thorough understanding of test-driven-development using jest, installation and operation of a webpack, and new features in ECMAScript 6, specifically including template literals and classes.  
The actual operation of this website is to tell the user how old they will be on either Mercury, Venus, Mars, or Jupiter, by asking for their given age and their estimated life expectancy. It will then perform some basic math and output to the user how "old" they would be considered on the expected planet, based on the planet's amount of rotations around the sun.  
For example, Mercury orbits the Sun completely every 88 Earth days, so someone who has orbited the sun 25 times on Earth, will have orbited the sun about 104 times in that same timeframe, and thus would be considered 104 years old.

## Specs
See the file under \_\_tests\_\_/supergalactic.jest.js for all function specifications.  
Open the file with your code reader of choice, or right-click and open with Notepad for simply viewing the file.
